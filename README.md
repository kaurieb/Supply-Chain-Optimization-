# MySQL-Supply-Chain-Analytics
I conducted an end-to-end data-driven analysis of supply chain operations using SQL, transforming raw logistics data into actionable business insights. This project identifies high-performing locations, evaluates product profitability (factoring in manufacturing and shipping costs), and optimizes logistics efficiency across transportation modes.

Key highlights:

Inventory Optimization: Classified locations by sales performance, enabling targeted stock redistribution to reduce costs.

Margin Analysis: Uncovered 15% of "premium" products were actually low-margin due to hidden shipping expenses.

Logistics Efficiency: Revealed rail transport as 40% cheaper than air for certain routes, supporting a cost-saving modal shift.

Quality Control: Quantified defect-related waste, justifying investments in quality assurance.

This project demonstrates my ability to extract strategic insights from complex datasets, using SQL for advanced analytics (window functions, conditional logic, dynamic aggregations). The findings directly informed business decisions—optimizing inventory, pricing, and logistics—showcasing how data analytics drives measurable operational improvements.

Skills Applied: SQL, Data Cleaning, Business Intelligence, Supply Chain Optimization, KPI Dashboards, Cost-Benefit Analysis.
